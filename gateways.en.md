What is a Gateway
----------

A Gateway in Ripple network is an issuer of a certain currency. When a user deposits in a gateway, the gateway send him a certificate of owning such an amount of that currency. This certificate can be routed within the Ripple network and exchanged in the free market. A gateway is responsible for cashing of the certificate as long as it was issued by it.

With the power of distributed storage and digital signature, this certificate can not be denied, sproofed and distoried by any third party.

Following is a list of gateways being supported at Fortune Harbor. If you are running a gateway and wish to be on the list, please [contact](contact.cn.md) us.
