投资财富港湾
==========



财富港湾同时是一种新型的利益共同体的模式探索，介于传统公司和完全开源项目之间。
不同于一般公司，它采用一种首创的[信用币](VED.cn.md)模式来运作和协调投资以及权属关系。在这种关系下，任何早期投资者与财富港湾都没有投资关系，初创人员与财富港湾也没有雇佣关系，一切皆基于自愿和共同的价值认可。

共同价值认可：

1. 基于现代密码学的分布式交易体系是人类历史的一大进步。与传统的基于中央授权、各自分割的金融体系相比，它极大地降低了运行的成本。任何极大提高效率的变革必将最终在某种形式上获得成功。
1. 由此衍生的新型合作模式将团体的投资者、权益归属者、初创者、经营者、投机者以更透明和高效的方式结合起来，符合全球化的趋势。
1. 越早发现和认可该价值，并且共同参与扩大该价值的人，有理由在将来获得更高的合理回报。

无论您打算成为我们的用户见证财富港湾成长，还是贡献资金或者投入劳动来发展财富港湾，同时为自己将来积累可能的财富，以下是详细的故事。

背景
----------


直到[比特币（Bitcoin）](http://bitcoin.org)出现，或者说Crypto-Currency，基于加密算法的分布式货币出现，这一变革才看到了曙光。在比特币之前，因为财富的敏感性，任何政府或者金融机构都力图把信息隐藏起来，外界知道的信息越少，整个系统越安全。现代密码学已经证明，单纯基于隐藏信息的系统安全方式远不如基于公认领域知识的数学加密方式可靠。比特币诞生以来的几年的零故障运行记录也已经证明分布式的交易系统远比集中式的交易中心可靠和低成本。(待插引用)

另一方面，人们也已经意识到，基于公开算法和算力的货币产生机制所产生的造假难度和公平性远优于金银为基础的传统货币，并且可以避免国家信用引起的动荡(待插引用-塞浦路斯金融动荡)和超发货币引发的全球性通货膨胀竞赛问题。
