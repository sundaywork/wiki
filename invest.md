----------

There isn't much revolution since the beginning of the bank industry, until the Bitcoin, or say Crypto-Currency, emerges. 

Before Bitcoin, all the currency system in the world is based on a certain physical thing that is difficult and switchable, such as gold, and a trust belief based on an entity such as a central bank. However, it is actually not as reliable as it looks like. Think about Aluminum or diamond. On the other side, over-issuing of the currency and inflation has become a global problem. 

Bitcoin created a way to link the wealth representation to the best knowledge and technology so far in the world. The reliability is based on the decentralized network which no single entity can control and the top of the mankind's wisdom of many years ahead.
