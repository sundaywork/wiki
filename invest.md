The background
----------

There isn't much revolution since the beginning of the bank industry, until the Bitcoin, or say Crypto-Currency, emerges. 

Before Bitcoin, all the currency system in the world is based on a certain physical thing that is difficult and switchable, such as gold, and a trust belief based on an entity such as a central bank. However, it is actually not as reliable as it looks like. Think about Aluminum or diamond. On the other side, over-issuing of the currency and inflation has become a global problem. 

Bitcoin created a way to link the wealth representation to the best knowledge and technology so far in the world. The reliability is based on the decentralized network which no single entity can control and the top of the mankind's wisdom of many years ahead.

Despite of the many advantages Bitcoin has, there are some fatal weaknesses of bitcoin: it is not compatible to the existing world currency, the cost of holding and transmitting is too high, and the confirmation of transaction is still too long. [Ripple]( https://ripple.com/) network comes to fix these problems. It is also math-based and decentralized, but moreover friendly to the common world and confirms any transaction in seconds.
